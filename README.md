## Project History
The reason why we want to create this platform is that we feel lack of advisement opportunies when we were in freshman or sophomore years. We missed career opportunies due to lack of insights and had limited resources to find someone more experienced to consult with. And once we grew more experienced, we feel difficult to help younger students reach their goals because there isn't a systematic way to offer resources and advice to those in need. For the advisor-rating functionality, we notice that many college students had unpleasant times working with their academic advisors, so we would like to create a rateMyProfessor-like platform for those who want to share their comments and ratings for their advisors.
